Implementation Plan for "Coliseum Duel"
Phase 1: Setting Up the Environment
Create the Basic Three.js Setup  
Set up a new Three.js project by creating a scene, camera, and renderer.  

Configure the renderer to display the game in the browser and set up a game loop using requestAnimationFrame.  

Add basic lighting, such as an ambient light and a directional light, to illuminate the scene.  

Guidance: Check the Three.js documentation for examples of a basic scene setup.

Build the Arena  
Create a large, flat floor using a plane geometry with a simple, cartoony texture (e.g., sand or stone).  

Add basic walls or barriers around the edges using box geometries.  

Optionally, include decorations like pillars or a crowd stand for extra flair.  

Guidance: Use low-poly shapes and simple materials to keep the game running smoothly.

Phase 2: Player Movement and Camera
Implement Player Movement  
Create a player object (e.g., a cube or a basic character model).  

Add keyboard controls for WASD movement:  
W: Move forward  

A: Strafe left  

S: Move backward  

D: Strafe right

Update the player’s position in the game loop based on which keys are pressed.  

Guidance: Use variables to track key states and test movement step-by-step.

Set Up the Locked-On Camera  
Position the camera behind the player, always facing the bot (opponent).  

Adjust the camera’s position and rotation dynamically as the player moves, keeping the bot in focus.  

Guidance: Use Three.js’s lookAt function to point the camera at the bot—experiment with distances to get the right feel.

Phase 3: Combat Mechanics
Implement Attacks  
Define four attack types triggered by arrow keys:  
Up Arrow: Downwards slash  

Down Arrow: Straight thrust  

Left Arrow: Left-to-right slash  

Right Arrow: Right-to-left slash

Add simple animations (e.g., moving a sword object) for each attack.  

Check if an attack hits the bot using basic collision detection (e.g., distance checks or hitboxes).  

Guidance: Start with placeholders like moving a cube for the sword—add polish later.

Implement Defense  
Enable blocking by holding Shift and pressing an arrow key (matching the four attack directions).  

Check if the block direction matches the bot’s attack direction to cancel damage.  

Add a visual indicator for blocking, like raising a shield or tilting the sword.  

Guidance: Use a state variable to track blocking and test with one direction first.

Phase 4: Bot AI and Health System
Create the Bot  
Add a bot object to the scene (similar to the player model).  

Implement basic movement: the bot should wander slowly and occasionally move toward or away from the player.  

Add random attacks: have the bot choose one of the four attack types at random intervals.  

Include occasional random blocks for defense.  

Guidance: Use timers to control when the bot acts—keep it simple for now.

Implement the Health System  
Assign 100 health points to both the player and the bot.  

Reduce health by 25 points when an attack lands successfully.  

End the duel when either the player’s or bot’s health reaches zero.  

Guidance: Use variables to track health and test with a single hit first.

Phase 5: User Interface (UI)
Add Health Bars  
Create health bars for the player and bot using simple shapes (e.g., rectangles) or images.  

Place the player’s health bar at the bottom of the screen and the bot’s at the top.  

Update the bars in real-time as health changes.  

Guidance: Use HTML/CSS overlays or Three.js’s UI tools—test with static bars first.

Phase 6: Polish and Testing
Add Sound Effects  
Include basic audio for sword clashes, hits, and blocks.  

Optionally, add a background crowd noise for atmosphere.  

Guidance: Find free sound effects online and test with one sound at a time.

Test and Debug  
Test each feature separately (e.g., movement, attacks, bot behavior).  

Check for smooth performance in the browser and fix any lag.  

Debug issues like collision errors or camera glitches.  

Guidance: Use browser developer tools to spot errors and optimize performance.

Additional Tips for Success
Start Small: Build and test one feature at a time—don’t rush to combine everything.  

Use Placeholders: Test with basic shapes (e.g., cubes) before adding fancy models or animations.  

Optimize for Web: Keep models and calculations simple to avoid slowdowns in the browser.  

Learn as You Go: Refer to the Three.js documentation often—it’s full of examples and explanations.  

Get Help if Needed: Search online tutorials or ask in developer forums if you hit a roadblock.
